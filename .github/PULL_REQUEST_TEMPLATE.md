<!--
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE SUBMITTING A PR!

Other than typos, spelling, or formatting problems in our docs, consider first opening an ISSUE or a DISCUSSION. 

Enhancements or bugs in a specification are not always easy to describe at first glance, requiring some discussions with other contributors before reaching a conclusion.

We kindly ask you to consider opening a discussion or an issue using the Github tab menu above. The community will be more than happy to discuss your proposals there.
