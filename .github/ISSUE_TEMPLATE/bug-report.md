<!-- 
Sometimes can be hard to describe a "bug" in a specification. So, before opening
a Bug Report, please consider opening a discussion using the "Discussions" tab.
The community will be more than happy to clarify a concern you might have.

If you see a typo, spelling error, or formatting issue in our docs, please open
a PR.
