## Reporting an Issue

If you have a question, consider opening a
[discussion](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/discussions).

To report an issue or to suggest an idea for a change that you haven't had time
to write up yet, open an
[issue](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/issues). It is best
to check our existing
[issues](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/issues) first to
see if a similar one has already been opened and discussed.

## Suggesting a Change

Enhancements or bugs in a specification are not always easy to describe at first
glance, requiring some discussions with other contributors before reaching a
conclusion.

Before opening a pull request, we kindly ask you to consider opening a
[discussion](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/discussions)
or an [issue](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/issues). The
community will be more than happy to discuss your proposals there.

Having the discussion or issue settled, please submit a
[pull request](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/pulls) (PR)
with the complete set of changes discussed with the community. See the
[Spec Formatting Conventions](#spec-formatting-conventions) section for the
guidelines we follow for how documents are formatted.

Each PR must be signed per the following section and have a link to the issue or
discussion.

### Fixing Typos, Spelling, and Formatting issues

Due to the amount of text a specification can have, typos, spelling, and
formatting issues are pretty common. In these cases, please submit a
[pull request](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/pulls)
directly only with the fixes that you see fit.

### Assigning and Owning work

If you want to own and work on an issue, add a comment or “#dibs” it asking
about ownership. A maintainer will then add the Assigned label and modify the
first comment in the issue to include `Assigned to: @person`

## Spec Formatting Conventions

Documents in this repository will adhere to the following rules:

- Lines are wrapped at 80 columns (when possible)
- Specifications will use [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)
  keywords to indicate normative requirements

## Checks

### Markdown style

Markdown files should be appropriately formatted before a pull request is sent out.
In this repository, we follow the
[markdownlint rules](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint#rules--aliases)
with some customizations. See [markdownlint](.markdownlint.yaml) or
[settings](.vscode/settings.json) for details.

We highly encourage using line breaks in markdown files at `80` characters
wide. Some tools can do it for you effectively. Please submit the proposal
to include your editor settings required to enable this behavior so the
out-of-the-box settings for this repository will be consistent.

If you are using Visual Studio Code,
you can also use the `fixAll` command of the
[vscode markdownlint extension](https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint).

To otherwise check for style violations, use:

```bash
# Ruby and gem are required for mdl
gem install mdl
mdl -c .mdlrc .
```

To fix style violations, follow the
[instruction](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint#optionsresultversion)
with the Node version of markdownlint.

### Typos

In addition, please make sure to clean up typos before you submit the change.

To check for typos, you may use

```bash
# Golang is needed for the misspell tool.
make install-misspell
make misspell
```

To quickly fix typos, use:

```bash
make misspell-correction
```
