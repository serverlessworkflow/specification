## SDKs

In addition to the documentation mentioned above, there is also a set of SDKs being developed and are part of the specification:

- [Go](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-go)
- [Java](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-java)

Being an open source community the Serverless Workflow team is open for new members as well open to their contributions. 
In order to ensure that an SDK is going to be supported and maintained, the Serverless Workflow community would like to ensure that:

* Each SDK has active points of contact.
* Each SDK supports the latest(N), and N-1, major releases of the specification.
* Within the scope of a major release, only support for the latest minor version is needed.

Support for release candidates is not required, but strongly encouraged.

## Tooling

In order to enhance developer experience with the specification, we also provide a [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=serverlessworkflow.serverless-workflow-vscode-extension).
The sources of the extension are found [here](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/vscode-extension).

In order to ensure that the VSCode Extension is going to be supported and maintained, the Serverless Workflow community 
would like to ensure that is has a dedicated point of contact.

## Community

We have an growing community working together to build a dynamic serverless workflow
ecosystem. Community contributions are welcome and much needed to foster specification growth.

See [here](community/contributors.md) for the list of all community members that have contributed to the specification.

To learn how to contribute to the specification reference the ['how to contribute'](contributing.md) doc.
