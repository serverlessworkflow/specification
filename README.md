##  About

CNCF Serverless Workflow defines a vendor-neutral, open-source, and fully community-driven
ecosystem for defining and running DSL-based workflows that target the Serverless technology domain.</h3>

This project is composed of:

* [Specification](specification.md) for defining DSL-based workflows
* [Developer SDKs](#sdks) for different programming languages
* [Workflow runtimes](#runtimes) supporting the specification
* Developer [tooling support](#tooling) for writing DSL-based workflows

CNCF Serverless Workflow is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) and was approved as a 
Cloud Native Sandbox level project on July 14, 2020.

## Runtimes

- [Synapse](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/synapse)

Serverless Workflow is open to host open-source runtime implementations that would like to
be part and grow alongside the core specification.

[Synapse](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/synapse) is a Kubernetes-native workflow runtime which supports and is part of the Serverless
Workflow eco-system.

## SDKs

- [Go](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-go)
- [Java](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-java)
- [.NET](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-net)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-typescript)

Serverless Workflow encourages development of SDKs dedicated to help developers with 
consuming, parsing, validating and testing their workflows that use the Serverless Workflow DSL.

## Tooling

In order to enhance developer experience with the specification, we also provide a [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=serverlessworkflow.serverless-workflow-vscode-extension).
The sources of the extension are found [here](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/vscode-extension).

## Community

We have a growing community working together to build a community-driven and vendor-neutral
workflow ecosystem. Community contributions are welcome and much needed to foster project growth.

See [here](community/contributors.md) for the list of community members that have contributed to the specification.

To learn how to contribute to the specification reference the ['how to contribute'](contributing.md) doc.
