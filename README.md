</p>

A specification for defining declarative workflow models
that orchestrate event-driven, serverless applications.

Serverless Workflow is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) and was approved as a 
Cloud Native Sandbox level project on July 14, 2020.

Main goals of the specification include:

- Facilitate Serverless Workflow portability across different vendor platforms
- Be completely vendor neutral
- Support both stateless and stateful Serverless Workflow orchestration
- Define a light-weight and powerful Serverless Workflow model

## Serverless Workflow Documents

The following documents are available:

|| Latest Release | Working Draft |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Specification:** | | |
| Serverless Workflow| [v0.1](https://github.com/cncf/wg-serverless/blob/v0.1/workflow/spec/spec.md) | [master](specification.md)  |

## SDKs

In addition to the documentation mentioned above, there is also a set of SDKs being developed and are part of the specification:

- [Go](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-go)
- [Java](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-java)

Being an open source community the Serverless Workflow team is open for new members as well open to their contributions. 
In order to ensure that an SDK is going to be supported and maintained the Serverless Workflow community would like to ensure that:

* Each SDK has active points of contact.
* Each SDK supports the latest(N), and N-1, major releases of the specification.
* Within the scope of a major release, only support for the latest minor version is needed.

Support for release candidates is not required, but strongly encouraged.

We have an growing community working together to build a dynamic serverless workflow
ecosystem. Community contributions are welcome and much needed to foster specification growth.
