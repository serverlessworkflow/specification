## Abstract

This document provides comprehensive definitions and detailed property tables for all the concepts discussed in the Serverless Workflow DSL. It serves as a reference guide, explaining the structure, components, and configurations available within the DSL. By exploring this document, users will gain a thorough understanding of how to define, configure, and manage workflows, including task definitions, flow directives, and state transitions. This foundational knowledge will enable users to effectively utilize the DSL for orchestrating serverless functions and automating processes.

## Definitions

### Workflow

A [workflow](#workflow) serves as a blueprint outlining the series of [tasks](#task) required to execute a specific business operation. It details the sequence in which [tasks](#task) must be completed, guiding users through the process from start to finish, and helps streamline operations, ensure consistency, and optimize efficiency within an organization.

### Task

A task within a [workflow](#workflow) represents a discrete unit of work that contributes to achieving the overall objectives defined by the [workflow](#workflow). 

It encapsulates a specific action or set of actions that need to be executed in a predefined order to advance the workflow towards its completion. 

[Tasks](#task) are designed to be modular and focused, each serving a distinct purpose within the broader context of the [workflow](#workflow). 

By breaking down the [workflow](#workflow) into manageable [tasks](#task), organizations can effectively coordinate and track progress, enabling efficient collaboration and ensuring that work is completed in a structured and organized manner.

The Serverless Workflow DSL defines a list of [tasks](#task) that **must be** supported by all runtimes:

- [Call](#call), used to call services and/or functions.
- [Do](#do), used to define one or more subtasks to perform in sequence.
- [Fork](#fork), used to define one or more subtasks to perform concurrently.
- [Emit](#emit), used to emit [events](#event-properties).
- [For](#for), used to iterate over a collection of items, and conditionally perform a task for each of them.
- [Listen](#listen), used to listen for an [event](#event-properties) or more.
- [Raise](#raise), used to raise an [error](#error) and potentially fault the [workflow](#workflow).
- [Run](#run), used to run a [container](#container-process), a [script](#script-process) , a [shell](#shell-process) command or even another [workflow](#workflow-process). 
- [Switch](#switch), used to dynamically select and execute one of multiple alternative paths based on specified conditions
- [Set](#set), used to dynamically set the [workflow](#workflow)'s data during the its execution. 
- [Try](#try), used to attempt executing a specified [task](#task), and to handle any resulting [errors](#error) gracefully, allowing the [workflow](#workflow) to continue without interruption.
- [Wait](#wait), used to pause or wait for a specified duration before proceeding to the next task.

#### Properties

|:--|:---:|:---:|:---|
| listen.to | [`eventConsumptionStrategy`](#event-consumption-strategy) | `yes` | Configures the [event(s)](https://cloudevents.io/) the workflow must listen to. |
| listen.read | `string` | `no` | Specifies how [events](https://cloudevents.io/) are read during the listen operation.<br>*Supported values are:*<br>*- `data`: Reads the [event's](https://cloudevents.io/) data.*<br>*- `envelope`: Reads the [event's](https://cloudevents.io/) envelope, including its [context attributes](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md#context-attributes).*<br>*- `raw`: Reads the [event's](https://cloudevents.io/) raw data.*<br>*Defaults to `data`.*|
| foreach | [`subscriptionIterator`](#subscription-iterator) | `no` | Configures the iterator, if any, for processing each consumed [event](https://cloudevents.io/). |

> [!NOTE]
> A `listen` task produces a sequentially ordered array of all the [events](https://cloudevents.io/) it has consumed, and potentially transformed using `foreach.output.as`.

> [!NOTE]
> When `foreach` is set, the configured operations for a [events](https://cloudevents.io/) must complete before moving on to the next one. As a result, consumed [events](https://cloudevents.io/) should be stored in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue while awaiting iteration.

> [!WARNING]
> [Events](https://cloudevents.io/) consumed by an `until` clause should not be included in the task's output. These [events](https://cloudevents.io/) are used solely to determine when the until condition has been met, and they do not contribute to the result or data produced by the task itself

              audiences: [ runtime ]
```

### Catalog

A **resource catalog** is an external collection of reusable components, such as functions, that can be referenced and imported into workflows. Catalogs allow workflows to integrate with externally defined resources, making it easier to manage reuse and versioning across different workflows.

Each catalog is defined by an `endpoint` property, specifying the root URL where the resources are hosted, enabling workflows to access external functions and services. For portability, catalogs must adhere to a specific file structure, as defined [here](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/catalog?tab=readme-ov-file#structure).

For more information about catalogs, refer to the [Serverless Workflow DSL document](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/blob/main/dsl.md#catalogs).

#### Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|:----:|:--------:|-------------|
| endpoint | [`endpoint`](#endpoint) | `yes` | The endpoint that defines the root URL at which the catalog is located. |

#### Examples

```yaml
document:
  dsl: '1.0.0'
  namespace: test
  name: catalog-example
  version: '0.1.0'
use:
  catalogs:
    global:
      endpoint:
        uri: https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/catalog
        authentication:
          basic:
            username: user
            password: '012345'
do:
  - log:
      call: log:0.5.2@global
      with:
        message: The cataloged custom function has been successfully called
```

### Extension

Holds the definition for extending functionality, providing configuration options for how an extension extends and interacts with other components.

Extensions enable the execution of tasks prior to those they extend, offering the flexibility to potentially bypass the extended task entirely using an [`exit` workflow directive](#flow-directive).

#### Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|:----:|:--------:|-------------|
| extend |  `string` | `yes` | The type of task to extend<br>Supported values are: `call`, `composite`, `emit`, `extension`, `for`, `listen`, `raise`, `run`, `set`, `switch`, `try`, `wait` and `all` |
| when | `string` | `no` | A runtime expression used to determine whether or not the extension should apply in the specified context |
| before | [`map[string, task][]`](#task) | `no` | The task to execute, if any, before the extended task |
| after | [`map[string, task][]`](#task) | `no` | The task to execute, if any, after the extended task |

#### Examples

                method: post
                endpoint: https://fake.log.collector.com
                body:
                  message: ${ "Executing task '\($task.reference)'..." }
        after:
          - sendLog:
              call: http
              with:
                method: post

                  message: ${ "Executed task '\($task.reference)'..." }
do:
  - sampleTask:
      call: http
      with:
        method: get
        endpoint: https://fake.com/sample
```

*Intercept HTTP calls to 'https://mocked.service.com' and mock its response:*
```yaml
document:  
  dsl: '1.0.0'
  namespace: test
  name: intercept-extension-example
  version: '0.1.0'
use:
  extensions:
    - mockService:
        extend: call
        when: $task.call == "http" and ($task.with.uri != null and ($task.with.uri | startswith("https://mocked.service.com"))) or ($task.with.endpoint.uri != null and ($task.with.endpoint.uri | startswith("https://mocked.service.com")))
        before:
          - intercept:
              set:
                statusCode: 200
                headers:
                  Content-Type: application/json
                content:
                  foo:
                    bar: baz
              then: exit #using this, we indicate to the workflow we want to exit the extended task, thus just returning what we injected
do:
  - sampleTask:
      call: http
      with:
        method: get
        endpoint: https://fake.com/sample

### Input

Documents the structure - and optionally configures the transformation of - workflow/task input data.

It's crucial for authors to document the schema of input data whenever feasible. This documentation empowers consuming applications to provide contextual auto-suggestions when handling runtime expressions.

When set, runtimes must validate raw input data against the defined schema before applying transformations, unless defined otherwise.

#### Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|:----:|:--------:|-------------|
| schema | [`schema`](#schema) | `no` | The [`schema`](#schema) used to describe and validate raw input data.<br>*Even though the schema is not required, it is strongly encouraged to document it, whenever feasible.* |

#### Examples

```yaml
schema:
  format: json
  document:
    type: object
    properties:
      order:
        type: object
        required: [ pet ]
        properties:
          pet:
            type: object
            required: [ id ]
            properties:
              id:
                type: string
from: .order.pet
```

### Output

Documents the structure - and optionally configures the transformations of - workflow/task output data.

It's crucial for authors to document the schema of output data whenever feasible. This documentation empowers consuming applications to provide contextual auto-suggestions when handling runtime expressions.

When set, runtimes must validate output data against the defined schema after applying transformations, unless defined otherwise.

#### Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |

      properties:
        petId:
          type: string
      required: [ petId ]
  as:
    petId: '${ .pet.id }'
```

### Export

Certain task needs to set the workflow context to save the task output for later usage. Users set the content of the context through a runtime expression. The result of the expression is the new value of the context. The expression is evaluated against the transformed task output.

Optionally, the context might have an associated schema which is validated against the result of the expression.

#### Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|:----:|:--------:|-------------|

```

### URI Template

The DSL has limited support for URI template syntax as defined by [RFC 6570](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570). Specifically, only the [Simple String Expansion](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570#section-3.2.2) is supported, which allows authors to embed variables in a URI.

To substitute a variable within a URI, use the `{}` syntax. The identifier inside the curly braces will be replaced with its value during runtime evaluation. If no value is found for the identifier, an empty string will be used.

This has the following limitations compared to runtime expressions:

- Only top-level properties can be interpolated within strings, thus identifiers are treated verbatim. This means that `{pet.id}` will be replaced with the value of the `"pet.id"` property, not the value of the `id` property of the `pet` property.
- The referenced variable must be of type `string`, `number`, `boolean`, or `null`. If the variable is of a different type an error with type `https://https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/expression` and status `400` will be raised.
- [Runtime expression arguments](./dsl.md#runtime-expression-arguments) are not available for string substitution.

#### Examples

```yaml
uri: https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet/{petId}
```

### AsyncAPI Outbound Message

Configures an AsyncAPI message to publish.

#### Properties

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|:-----|:----:|:--------:|:------------|
| payload | `object` | `no` | The message's payload, if any. |
| headers | `object` | `no` | The message's headers, if any. |

#### Examples

```yaml
document:
  dsl: '1.0.0'
  namespace: test
  name: asyncapi-example
  version: '0.1.0'
do:
  - publishGreetings:
      call: asyncapi
      with:
        document:
          endpoint: https://fake.com/docs/asyncapi.json
        operation: greet
        protocol: http
        message:
          payload:
            greetings: Hello, World!
          headers:
            foo: bar
            bar: baz
```

### AsyncAPI Inbound Message

Configures an AsyncAPI message consumed by a subscription.

#### Properties

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|:-------|:------:|:----------:|:--------------|
| payload | `object` | `no` | The message's payload, if any. |
| headers | `object` | `no` | The message's headers, if any. |
| correlationId | `string` | `no` | The message's correlation id, if any. |

#### Examples

```yaml
payload:
  greetings: Hello, World!
headers:
  foo: bar
  bar: baz
correlationid: '123456'
```

### AsyncAPI Subscription

Configures a subscription to an AsyncAPI operation.

#### Properties

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|:-------|:------:|:----------:|:--------------|
| filter | `string` | `no` | A [runtime expression](dsl.md#runtime-expressions), if any, used to filter consumed [messages](#asyncapi-inbound-message). |
| consume | [`subscriptionLifetime`](#asyncapi-subscription-lifetime) | `yes` | An object used to configure the subscription's lifetime. |
| foreach | [`subscriptionIterator`](#subscription-iterator) | `no` | Configures the iterator, if any, for processing each consumed [message](#asyncapi-inbound-message). |

> [!NOTE]
> An AsyncAPI subscribe operation call produces a sequentially ordered array of all the [messages](#asyncapi-inbound-message) it has consumed, and potentially transformed using `foreach.output.as`.

> [!NOTE]
> When `foreach` is set, the configured operations for a [message](#asyncapi-inbound-message) must complete before moving on to the next one. As a result, consumed [messages](#asyncapi-inbound-message) should be stored in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue while awaiting iteration.

#### Examples

```yaml
document:
  dsl: '1.0.0'
  namespace: test
  name: asyncapi-example
  version: '0.1.0'
do:
  - subscribeToChatInboxForAmount:
      call: asyncapi
      with:
        document:
          endpoint: https://fake.com/docs/asyncapi.json

            amount: 5
            for:
              seconds: 10
```

### AsyncAPI Subscription Lifetime

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|:-----|:----:|:--------:|:------------|
| amount | `integer` | `no` | The amount of messages to consume.<br>*Required if `while` and `until` have not been set.* |
| for | [`duration`](#duration) | `no` | The [`duration`](#duration) that defines for how long to consume messages. |
| while | `string` | `no` | A [runtime expression](dsl.md#runtime-expressions), if any, used to determine whether or not to keep consuming messages.<br>*Required if `amount` and `until` have not been set.* |
| until | `string` | `no` | A [runtime expression](dsl.md#runtime-expressions), if any, used to determine until when to consume messages.<br>*Required if `amount` and `while` have not been set.* |
