# Comparisons - BPMN2

The [Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/PDF) defines a flowchart-based
DSL for workflows. It is maintained by the [Object Management Group (OMG)](https://www.omg.org/). 
The latest BPMN version is [2.0.2](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/), published in 2014.

BPMN2 defines a graphical notation to specify workflows. This notation can then be shared between tooling and organizations.
The graphical notation is translated into XML, which then can be used for runtime execution.

For this comparison, we will compare the Serverless Workflow language with the graphical representation of BPMN2,
and not its underlying XML representation. The BPMN2 XML is very difficult to understand, quite large for even the smallest workflows, and often not portable between runtimes. 
It makes more sense to use its portable graphical notation for comparisons.

Serverless Workflow is a declarative workflow language, represented with JSON or YAML. It currently does not define a graphical notation. However, it can be graphically represented using different flowcharting techniques such as 
UML activity diagrams. The [Serverless Workflow Java SDK](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/sdk-java#building-workflow-diagram) as well as its [VSCode Extension](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/vscode-extension) provide means to generate SVG diagrams based on the workflow JSON/YAML. 

## Note when reading provided examples

The BPMN2 graphical notation does not provide details about data inputs/outputs, mapping, and transformation. 
BPMN2 does provide graphical representation for things such as Data Objects. However, most of the examples
available do not use them. Execution semantics such as task and event properties are also not visual.
For this reason, the event, function, retry, and data mapping defined in the associated Serverless Workflow YAML are assumed.

a starting "operation" state transitioning to an "event" state that waits for the needed event.
