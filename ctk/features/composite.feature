Feature: Composite Task
  As an implementer of the workflow DSL
  I want to ensure that composite tasks can be executed within the workflow
  So that my implementation conforms to the expected behavior

  # Tests composite tasks with sequential sub tasks
  Scenario: Composite Task With Sequential Sub Tasks
    Given a workflow with definition:
    """yaml
    document:
      dsl: 1.0.0-alpha1
      namespace: default
      name: composite-sequential
    do:
      setRGB:
        execute:
          sequentially:
            setRed:
              set:
                colors: ${ .colors + ["red"] }
            setGreen:
              set:
                colors: ${ .colors + ["green"] }
            setBlue:
              set:
                colors: ${ .colors + ["blue"] }
    """
    When the workflow is executed
    Then the workflow should complete with output:
    """yaml
    colors: [ red, green, blue ]
    """

  # Tests composite tasks With competing concurrent sub tasks
  Scenario: Composite Task With Competing Concurrent Sub Tasks
    Given a workflow with definition:
    """yaml
    document:
      dsl: 1.0.0-alpha1
      namespace: default
      name: composite-sequential

          compete: true
    """
    When the workflow is executed
    Then the workflow should complete
    And the workflow output should have a 'colors' property containing 1 items
